# hydra-blending-modes

## **warning : deprecated !! use hydra-blend instead**

Very simple but useful blending modes for Hydra. They all lack an intensity argument as of now.
Taken from [hydra-blocky](https://github.com/samarthgulati/hydra-blockly/).
Specifically [this file](https://github.com/samarthgulati/hydra-blockly/blob/master/image-editing-glsl-functions.js).

See all available blending modes by evaluating:

```js
> console.log(blendmodes_list)
```

```js
{
  0: "darken",
  1: "multiply",
  2: "colorBurn",
